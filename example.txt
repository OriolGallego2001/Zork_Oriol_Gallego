#This is the world json where you can define the world for your zork game, follow this instructions:
#First create rooms using the example structure, name and description and before the opening brackets I reccomend to store the
#position of the room starting with 0

#You can use comments to help identify rooms: RoomID = 0

    name: First room
    description: The initial room
}

#Once you have the rooms then connect them using exits, room_id is the room that will contain the exit, direction is the input 
#that the game expects to use the exit when you are in that room, and exit_id is the room that the creature moved will go to.


#This first exit for example defines that the room 1 (the Forest in the example file) will have an exit when going north/n
#that will move a creature to the room 0(the treasure room in the example file)

#When you have your map defined it is time for your creatures, similarly you have to place them in a room by giving the room id

#A dragon is a creature that you will have to distract to advance North try building a *Bait*

#Finally define the default items and place them in rooms or creatures, be careful you might not be able yet to steal items 
#from other creatures, but if the player has an item from the begining you will be able to use it.
#Take into consideration the owner is the entity holding the item (items can hold items too!) and the item size defines its
#weight which determines if you can pick it up as the player.
