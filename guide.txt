The goal of the game is to obtain the gold guarded by a dragon. To accomplish this you must pick up first all the items.

In the first room you can start picking up a Paper(input: "pick Paper"), and you already begin with a Stick.

Then if you move two rooms north(input: "n", input:"n") there is a bagpack which increases your capacity to hold items, pick it up too (input:"pick bagpack")

After picking up the bagpack go south again to the initial room, where there is a Rock and pick it up. (input: "s", input: "s", input:"pick Rock")

Once you have all the items you can go north until a dragon blocks your path (input: "n" four times) 

There you will have to build a Bait to advance (input: "build Bait") 

Finally you can go north and pick the gold and finish the game (input: "n", input:"pick gold").
